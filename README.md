Currently, there's not much to say. I'm just starting this out.
Right now there is:
  -TrackConnect.py
  -RetimeCamera.py
  
  TrackConnect has been pretty extensively tested, mostly by myself, but I cannot vouch for it's overall stability. I will be updating this over time.
  
  RetimeCamera however is still being tested. It may prove overall somewhat finicky as I still need to make several updates to it.
  
  That is all for now!
